The main aim of the project is to provide a simple, efficient and handy system 
with the concepts of ML as their core functionality so that we can rely on the 
system for accurate results. The whole procedure is simple. It means that we 
have added some functionalities and features mentioned in flow chart. To this 
system, we will be giving random inputs to check its functioning, response 
generation, errors and time complexity to learn the system's efficiency.In this project i have used Multilayer Perceptron algorithm and trained the model.We got 
an accuracy of 90.62% in trained model and 71% in test model.
